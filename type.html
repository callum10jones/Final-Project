                    <p>Bilateral:<br>Bilateral designs are super popular as they're merely centred text. Words are the bricks in a bilateral system, and the entire design is like a wall. To put it another way, creating a design in a bilateral system is similar to constructing a wall out of bricks, and the result is typically very boxy. Non-objective elements, like the other systems, can add visual intrigue, emphasis, or balance, like what I've done with the shapes.<br><br>Dilatational:<br>Dilatational designs use typeset along circular paths. In other words, instead of radiating out from a point like radial designs, the text forms curves around a point. The dilatational system can also handle more text than the radial method. In contrast to the radial piece, the content in my piece radiates across multiple rings and holds larger amounts of text.<br><br>Grid:<br>Grid Systems refers to a technique of vertical and horizontal divisions. Because the text is placed first in a grid, there is rarely any doubt about readability. This method works on different media, like posters, books, essays, websites, cards, and just about anything else.<br><br>Modular:<br>Modular layouts use repeating structures to break up the content. These structures can take any form, but the most common are shapes. Create a system that is repeatable and matches the material. For example, I organised my content into squares that resembled a grid.<br><br>Radial:<br>Radial Systems refers to the placement of the majority of the body text radioactively around a central point. The only drawback with the radial approach is that it may only function when the text isn't too big, but it's great for posters and interactive websites. In my example, I made the central focal point a black circle and arranged all of the content so it radiates outwards from that point.<br><br>Random:<br>Random Systems have no rules. The elements are placed without a clear goal, pattern, direction, rule, technique, or purpose in mind. In my example, the texts are of different sizes, shapes and proportions. Despite the mess, the work is readable.<br><br>Transitional:<br>Transitional designs are a unique typographic system because they appear disorganised in most projects. However, they work well for posters and book covers, which worked with the following content. There's some movement or slippage as if the text is being slid into place. In my piece, the content slides to the right with a wave-like pattern.</p></div>
