                    <h2>Coding Task #1</h2>
                    <p>The first task was an introduction to HTML and CSS, a simple task where our objective was to follow and experiment with these languages with a set of guidelines. We went from one page to two, and we were able to use both pages through a single CSS file, which is far more efficient because it eliminates the need to click between files. Additionally, there was a small introduction to Flexbox, something we expanded drastically on in the next segment.</p></div>

                    <h2>Coding Task #2</h2>
                    <p>The second task talked about Flexbox; Flexible Box makes it easy to develop responsive layout frameworks. The Flexbox properties are supported in all modern browsers. Successfully, this coding task managed to introduce a responsive framework that would help us with our final static website. Additionally, we were introduced to the idea of placeholders, something such as an image that occupies the position or place of another thing. This was great for getting the idea of image sizing for when we'd resize them in other applications.</p></div>
