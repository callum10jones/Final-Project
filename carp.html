                    <h2>Graphic #1</h2>
                    <p>This poster's colour scheme integrates each colour from the True/False logo. The use of the colour red as the headings primary colour allows for a bold entry to the viewer's eyes, as their focus is almost instantly on the name of the festival; plus it's the brightest colour on the poster. All of the text is aligned to the centre and are split into quadrants which all relate. For example, the heading includes its name, when and where the festival takes place and a small tagline. Both segments of text below the heading share a similar style, both centred and similar lengths.

                    <h2>Graphic #2</h2>
                    <p>This poster's main attraction, a still frame from the Oscar-Nominated Documentary "The Look of Silence" by Joshua Oppenheimer; a documentary shown at the True/False Festival. I selected this image because the man's glasses similarly resemble the logo with a similar shape and colour. I created a black box at the bottom of the page to help make the text readable for the viewer; this also doubles as a high contrast because both colours are opposites. I grouped all similar information to help give all important information straight up and to the point.

                    <p>The image in the backdrop is of Agnès Varda, a well-known French filmmaker who has directed numerous documentaries and feature films. Because the human brain reacts strongly to bright colours, I picked brilliant colour combinations that are quickly recognised and remembered. The top of the gradient is a lot darker than the bottom, so using lighter coloured text helped for readability. Additionally, I put proximate material together to make it easier to convey all pertinent facts quickly.</p></div>
