                <p>My first project walked me through the fundamentals of graphic design, principles of typographic design and how to create imaginative work that is fascinating, dynamic, and thoughtful. Using the fundamentals of HTML and CSS learned in class, I assembled a static website to present the graphical, typographic, and UX foundations, along with short reflection paragraphs to accompany each task. I built the website from the ground up using Visual Studio Code and used version control in Github Desktop to keep track of my code; I also used GitHub to publish and host the static website.<br><br>
                I created a fully functional multi-page website that showcased all the worksheet tasks. I already had some experience with coding thanks to Bootstrap, but for this project, I merely used raw HTML and CSS. For the website, I chose a colour scheme based on the poster for "L'Atalante," a Poetic Realism film from France. I selected this because it has a pleasing colour palette and adds personality to my website. When I plotted the gradient background, I used a lighter and softer gradient with less colour contrast; this creates a more comfortable and relaxed environment when the user opens the website. Furthermore, the background colours never clashed with the foreground colours due to the light writing on top of the darker backdrop. The final static website turned out exactly how I had envisioned it in my Wireframe; an introduction section was placed on the "Index" page, followed by an "About Me" section, and ultimately a presentation of all my tasks in the "Portfolio" area.<br><br>
                One of the most significant limitations was time; I only had a restricted schedule to create all the graphical, typographic, and UX foundations while coding and styling the entire website. As a result, I believe that aspects of the project could have been developed further. Although the website is responsive on desktops and laptops, it does not look as good on mobile devices, as it becomes all disorganised and chaotic with minimised to that resolution. With more time on my hands, I believe I could re-evaluate the code and solve the problem.<br><br>
                Ultimately, the built website was intended to demonstrate my graphical, typographic, and UX design skills. It allowed me to practise and enhance my coding skills while broadening my understanding of design concepts. I was well aware that the combination of colours can determine between users clicking open or avoiding the page entirely. A proper design can increase the number of visitors to a website while also improving the overall user experience. I looked into major themes in both online and graphic design, resulting in a variety of work that will be shown in my own working website that appeared and functioned exactly as I had envisioned.</p>
